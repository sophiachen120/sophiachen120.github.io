## About Me

Hi, I'm Sophia Chen, a student interested in text-based game design.  
This project was part of my final quest in Computer Programming Fundamentals, and it reflects what I‚Äôve learned about arrays.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *2048 Game*   
**One-line pitch:** Combine the tiles to make 2048!
